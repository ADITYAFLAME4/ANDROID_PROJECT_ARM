# ANDROID_PROJECT_ARM

This is a real-time project called "Dharmashala" for Ananta which was assigned to them by their client, an android application to book some slots for Hindu pilgrimage.
In this app, anyone can view ad of Dharmashala in stories just like instagram, can book slots for food and living at lowest cost and browse through the places , book them and plan accordingly.
I mostly had worked on the login and Sign up page and the story page of the app which was able to reduce the hassle of booking by 25-40% approximately and worked with database(Firebase) .
